Additionally, there's a noticeable emphasis on certain syllables, such as 'to all,' which could suggest anger or frustration. Stress patterns, such as the ones found in 'whatev-ah' (0.80-1.36), also contribute to the overall negative mood. Lastly, the presence of tremors in the voice, particularly noticeable towards the end of the recording (9.00-10.00), reinforces the negative emotional state of the speaker."
